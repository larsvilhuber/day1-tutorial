# Data Cleaning

## Need to merge the data

Write a merging script. Create the sample.

These two can go in the same script, `create_sample.do`

## Where does the merged data go?

Where does the newly merged data go? 

> No overwriting! 

The merged data should go in the `data/generated` directory.

## Moving things around

- Create directories
- Consolidate paths
- Time to write a main file!
