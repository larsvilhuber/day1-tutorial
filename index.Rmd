# Reproducibility from Day 1

Journals require that you **share your code and data** in a replication package at the end of your research project. 

Following some best practices from day 1 can not only **help you prepare** this package later, but also make you **more productive** researchers. 

## What is a replication package?

- [AEA Data and Code Availability policy](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/data/data-code-policy)
- [Data and Code Availability Standard](https://datacodestandard.org/) ![](https://datacodestandard.org/assets/img/DCAS-1.0.png) 
- [AEA Data and Code Repository](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/search/aea/studies)

## Goal

- [ ] Illustrate principles of reproducible research from the start
- [ ] Stay reasonably close to an ideal reproducibility Standard
- [ ] Use tools that are widely available and easy to use

## Scenario

We start with an empty folder, and an idea.
