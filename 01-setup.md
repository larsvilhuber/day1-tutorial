# Setup


## Tools needed: 

  - **Stata**. It is feasible to do the whole exercise in R as well, but examples will be in Stata.
  - **text editor** (we suggest [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
  - web browser
  - file browser (e.g., Windows Explorer, Finder, Nautilus, etc.)

## First steps

1. Create an empty folder, like `Desktop/day1`
2. Navigate to this folder in Stata: `cd ../Desktop/day1`
3. Open this folder in your text editor, if it can open folders (optional)
4. Google "[CEPII GeoDist](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=cepii+geodist&ia=web)"
